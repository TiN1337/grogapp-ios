# grogapp-ios
GroG App, for iOS.
Reference client for the GroG Platform (http://getgrog.com). The platform itself is still in development,
and as such may not be up or working all the time. Nonetheless, this client should give a good idea of how developers
can write their own clients. I'll try my best to keep it up to date with the server API, but I make no promises.
